This documents documents the styling of the Ember webapp and Metalsmith website. In 2020, we started migrating
to a React webapp and a NextJs website. At the time of writing this, we're not certain, how we will document

it will be easy to miss a change and therefore have a misleading styleguide. In that case we would start
from scratch.
